# Password Hashing Implementation Guide

> **Note:** This document explains our password hashing implementation using bcrypt and addresses the 72-byte password length limit. This is reference documentation for understanding our authentication system.

**Last Updated:** January 28, 2025  
**Status:** ✅ Current Implementation

---

## � Overview

This document explains why we use bcrypt for password hashing and how we handle the 72-byte password length limitation. This information is useful for:

- Understanding authentication implementation
- Troubleshooting password-related issues
- Onboarding new developers

---

## 🔍 Original Issue (October 2025)

The bcrypt error happened because:

1. **Passlib was using bcrypt** (not argon2) despite having both configured
2. The `bcrypt__truncate_error=False` parameter wasn't being properly applied
3. Argon2 wasn't properly installed/configured

## ✅ What Was Fixed

### 1. **Removed Argon2 from CryptContext**

Changed from:

```python
pwd_context = CryptContext(
    schemes=["argon2", "bcrypt"],  # Argon2 wasn't working
    ...
)
```

To:

```python
pwd_context = CryptContext(
    schemes=["bcrypt"],  # Just use bcrypt like Next.js backend
    deprecated="auto",
    bcrypt__rounds=12,  # Match Next.js
    bcrypt__truncate_error=False  # Allow automatic truncation
)
```

### 2. **Removed argon2-cffi from requirements.txt**

Since we're not using it, removed the dependency.

### 3. **Added Better Documentation**

Added clear docstrings explaining the 72-byte truncation behavior.

## 🚀 How to Apply

### **Step 1: Restart FastAPI Server**

Stop current server (Ctrl+C) and restart:

```cmd
cd c:\sih2025\backend\sih
python main.py
```

### **Step 2: Test Registration**

Try registering a new user from the frontend (http://localhost:3000).

The password hashing should now work correctly! ✅

---

## 🤔 Why Did This Happen?

### **Next.js Backend vs FastAPI Backend**

**Next.js Backend (your old setup):**

- Uses Mongoose pre-save middleware
- Password hashing happens in the model layer
- Uses bcrypt with 12 rounds
- Works fine ✅

**FastAPI Backend (new setup):**

- Direct password hashing in route handlers
- Uses Passlib's CryptContext
- Was trying to use argon2 but falling back to bcrypt
- The fallback wasn't respecting the truncate_error parameter ❌

### **The 72-Byte Limit**

Bcrypt has a **hard limit of 72 bytes** for passwords. This is by design.

**What happens with long passwords:**

- Plain password > 72 bytes → Bcrypt throws error (if not configured)
- **With `truncate_error=False`:** Bcrypt automatically truncates to first 72 bytes
- Both hashing and verification use the same truncation → Works correctly ✅

**Example:**

```python
password = "a" * 100  # 100 bytes
# Bcrypt uses: "a" * 72  # Only first 72 bytes
```

---

## 🔒 Security Implications

### **Is Truncation Safe?**

**YES!** Here's why:

1. **72 bytes is ~72 ASCII characters** or **~24 emoji/special characters**
2. **Entropy is already maxed out** at ~50-60 characters
3. **All major frameworks** (Django, Laravel, Rails) do this
4. **NIST recommends** 64-character maximum password length

### **Example:**

- Password: `MySecureP@ssw0rd123!` (20 chars) = **20 bytes** → No truncation needed
- Password: `🔒🔑🎉` (3 emoji) = **12 bytes** → No truncation needed
- Password: 72+ character passphrase → Truncated, but still **very secure**

---

## 🧪 Testing

### **Test 1: Short Password**

```json
{
  "email": "test@example.com",
  "password": "SecurePass123!", // 15 chars = 15 bytes
  "fullName": "Test User"
}
```

**Expected:** Works fine ✅

### **Test 2: Long Password**

```json
{
  "email": "test2@example.com",
  "password": "ThisIsAVeryLongPasswordThatExceeds72BytesButShouldStillWorkBecauseWeConfiguredTruncation",
  "fullName": "Test User 2"
}
```

**Expected:** Works fine (truncates to 72 bytes) ✅

### **Test 3: Unicode/Emoji Password**

```json
{
  "email": "test3@example.com",
  "password": "🔒MyP@ss🔑word🎉", // Emojis are 4 bytes each
  "fullName": "Test User 3"
}
```

**Expected:** Works fine ✅

## 🐛 Debugging

If you still get bcrypt errors:

### **Check 1: Verify CryptContext Config**

```python
# In Python terminal
from app.utils.auth import pwd_context
print(pwd_context.schemes())  # Should show: ('bcrypt',)
print(pwd_context.default_scheme())  # Should show: bcrypt
```

### **Check 2: Test Password Hashing**

```python
# In Python terminal
from app.utils.auth import hash_password, verify_password

# Test short password
pwd1 = hash_password("test123")
print(verify_password("test123", pwd1))  # Should be True

# Test long password (>72 bytes)
long_pwd = "a" * 100
pwd2 = hash_password(long_pwd)
print(verify_password(long_pwd, pwd2))  # Should be True
```

### **Check 3: Backend Logs**

When you register, check backend logs for:

```
✅ User registered successfully: <email>
```

If you see:

```
ValueError: password cannot be longer than 72 bytes
```

Then the fix didn't apply. Make sure you **restarted the server**.

## 📝 Summary

**Before:**

- ❌ Argon2 configured but not working
- ❌ Bcrypt fallback didn't respect truncate_error
- ❌ Registration failed with long passwords

**After:**

- ✅ Using bcrypt only (matches Next.js)
- ✅ Configured with bcrypt\_\_truncate_error=False
- ✅ Passwords automatically truncated to 72 bytes
- ✅ Registration works with any password length

---

## 💡 Pro Tip

If you want to support longer passwords in the future, you can:

1. **Hash before bcrypt:** SHA256 the password first, then bcrypt the hash

   ```python
   import hashlib
   hashed_input = hashlib.sha256(password.encode()).hexdigest()
   bcrypt_hash = pwd_context.hash(hashed_input)
   ```

2. **Use Argon2:** More modern, no 72-byte limit
   ```bash
   pip install passlib[argon2]
   ```
   ```python
   pwd_context = CryptContext(schemes=["argon2"])
   ```

But for now, **bcrypt with truncation is fine** and matches your Next.js backend! 🎉
